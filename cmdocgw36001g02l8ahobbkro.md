Working as an engineer in multiple startups has taught me a hard truth: it’s rare to see technical and non-technical teams truly function as one cohesive unit. When executives lack technical expertise, this divide only widens, creating friction that stalls progress. Even within IT teams, communication breakdowns between AI engineers, backend developers, and frontend developers are increasingly common—especially when leadership doesn’t understand AI. The result? Misaligned goals, wasted resources, and missed opportunities.

## The Trap of Research-Driven AI Engineers

AI engineers often fall into the trap of prioritizing research and experimentation over practical outcomes. It’s tempting to chase cutting-edge ideas or build proprietary solutions from scratch, but this can be a risky move. With high-performing models being released regularly—many of which are free or low-cost—deciding whether to develop in-house technology or leverage open-source tools is critical. A skilled AI engineer doesn’t just code; they strategize. They weigh the company’s financial resources, expected revenue, and whether the AI is meant to boost internal efficiency or drive external services.

## The Communication Challenge

The gap between technical and non-technical teams—or even between AI and other developers—often stems from poor communication. When executives don’t grasp AI’s potential or limitations, they can’t align it with business goals. Meanwhile, AI engineers who focus solely on their own research interests risk isolating themselves, failing to address the company’s broader needs. Bridging this gap requires translating complex AI concepts into clear, actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders and aligning technical efforts with business priorities.

## The Role of Organizational Culture

At the heart of these challenges lies the company’s culture, shaped by the CEO’s hiring philosophy. A truly skilled AI engineer thrives in an environment that fosters collaboration, values technical expertise, and encourages strategic decision-making. Unfortunately, transforming a company’s culture is no small feat. As an AI engineer working across startups, I’ve seen how deeply rooted these issues are, and changing them as an individual feels nearly impossible.

## What Makes a Truly Skilled AI Engineer?

A great AI engineer is more than a coder or researcher. They are:

* **Strategic Thinkers**: They balance the use of open-source tools with in-house development based on the company’s goals and resources.
    
* **Effective Communicators**: They bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams, ensuring alignment.
    
* **Business-Savvy**: They understand the company’s financial constraints and revenue expectations, tailoring solutions accordingly.
    
* **Adaptable**: They stay updated on AI advancements while focusing on practical, impactful applications.
    

In a world where AI is transforming industries, the ability to align technology with business needs is what sets exceptional AI engineers apart. It’s not just about building models—it’s about building bridges.
